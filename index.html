	  <h3>This Visualization focuses on police shootings that has become a controversial topic recently. The controversy going around on policeshootings is that US police department is more critical towards black people rathan than the White people. But some people belive the otherway around.
	These piecharts narrates two percpectives of this story.The dataset used for the visualization can be found here https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/police-killings/police_killings.csv</h3>
  <h3>As we can see from the first visualization when we consider number of deaths it is visible that white people are killed more than black by the police, Therefore many argue that Police are not attacking based on race. But when we take proportions into consideration it can be seen that 25% of all the black people are attacked while only 15% of white people are attacked.</h3>
